# testsuite

This project I started, so I can easily start test suites for different test frameworks with only one command. For me it was important that the test results are write in an HTML file.

In addition a small tool has come, what the configuration file loads to represent the testing of a tree. Here you can select or deselect tests. If all tests are selected, they can be started. Finally, we display the generated HTML file.
